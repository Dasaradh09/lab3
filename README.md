Hello , my name is Dasaradh Balusu my purusing my master's in information techonology managment , I have lot of interest in web devlopment that made me choose web applications in last time and for this sem i've opted for full stack devlopment ITMD 542. This assignment i worked on lot of things which is interesting to work as it deals with node js, api, rendering and routing. In this assignment i have learned CRUD operations. This project is more like a contact directory which has all the key things like view,edit,delete, add new contact and save it back to json file where we will store all our data.I have developed all my project work in vs code  v20.11.0. verision. in my m1 macbook air and have installed node js as well as npm and express.So when coming to main part running this project requires you to download project and install node js along with npm and bootstrap. As i properly styled things new css and bootstrap framework. Then run node app.js in terminal with npm start. There you are in my project webpage. the most challenging part is handling route and directories and connectivity. Read and writing files from json files is big task.
